## Data Encryption Standard (DES) Encryption Scheme

his [**C#**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) project implements the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** Symmetric Encryption Scheme. 


## Compile and Run
  
  Writing C# Programs on Linux:
  
  Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Check for [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).
  
  To Compile:
  
  > **mcs DES.cs**
  
  The compiler will create **"DES.exe"**, which you can run using:
  
  > **mono DES.exe**
